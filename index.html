            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>John Daghita, known online by the alias "Lick" or simply "John," is a 21-year-old American linked to one of the most high-profile insider cryptocurrency theft cases of the decade. He is accused of stealing over <strong>$40 million</strong> in cryptocurrency from U.S. government-controlled seizure wallets, with total on-chain connections to more than <strong>$90 million</strong> in suspected illicit flows. The case became public in January 2026 after blockchain investigator ZachXBT published a detailed thread connecting Daghita's online persona to wallet addresses holding stolen government funds.</p>

            <p>The story is remarkable for its sheer recklessness. Daghita did not get caught through sophisticated law enforcement tracing or a whistleblower. He exposed himself by bragging about his crypto holdings in a Telegram group chat, screen-sharing his wallets for the world to see.</p>

                    <p>Dean Daghita founded CMDSS, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, in 2011. In October 2024, CMDSS was awarded a <strong>$4 million contract</strong> by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to manage seized cryptocurrency assets. This contract is central to the scandal, providing the access point for the alleged theft.</p>

            <h3>"Vibe Coded" on Cursor</h3>
            <p>According to reports, John Daghita leveraged his father's government contract to gain insider access. In a leaked clip, he claimed to have been hired through nepotism and "vibe coded the whole thing on Cursor," building a fake exchange interface. This interface made it appear that seized funds were being sold legitimately, while in reality, they were routed to his personal wallets.</p>

            <h2>The Exposure: Band for Band</h2>
            <p>The unraveling began with a petty argument on Telegram. Another user, Dritan Kapplani Jr., mocked Daghita, triggering a "band for band" (b4b) challenge where participants screen-share wallets to prove wealth.</p>

            <h3>ZachXBT's Investigation</h3>
            <p>On January 23, 2026, ZachXBT published a thread tracing the wallets shown in the video back to U.S. government-controlled addresses, specifically those holding assets from the 2016 Bitfinex hack seizure. This confirmed the link between "Lick" and the stolen government funds.</p>
